Imagine you want to train an AI to recognize photos of doctors. If you train it using 1,000 photos, and 950 of them are men, the AI will learn that doctors are usually men. It might then have trouble recognizing a female doctor. The data was 'biased', so the AI became biased too."

Some real AI systems built for hiring have been found to favour male candidates because they were trained on data from a time when mostly men were hired.
